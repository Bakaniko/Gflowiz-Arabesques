Built in javascript and HTML 5, it provides a full toolset to filter you data and simplify it in order to make clearer and understandable maps. This document aims to present the application and its fonctionnalities using the provided datasets. The documentation is segmented in several parts: Main page Main functionnalities Import a dataset Please find the application at this address : arabesque.ifsttar.fr and more information on the project here : geoflowiz.hypotheses.org. Please report any issue on GitHub. This is a Free and OpenSource project, feel free to help us make it better. About the Gflowiz project Arabesque is part of the Gflowiz research project on flow maps in the geoweb. "],

Please find it in the Demo section and click on the Explore button (1). Launching Swiss communting example You might be greeted by a warning message. This is normal, if Arabesque find nodes without links or links without nodes, it will remove them. It is based on a join on nodes IDs. Cleaning the dataset Click on Ok. 2.2 Panels Arabesque is divided by default in 3 panels: Layer management panel Map panel Data handling panel Arabesques panels The side panels (layer and data) can be hidden by clicking on the arrows on the side. 2.2.1 Layer management panel The layer panel contains several buttons and tools to handle the layers. Arabesques panels Home button to get back to Welcome page Projection : click to deploy the projection tool Title : dialog box to change map title Add layers: toolbox to add layers Layers : area where you can manipulate the layer Letâ€™s see those how they work. 2.2.1.1 Projection tool By default, entry data and project are into WGS84 (EPSG:4326), which is a Geographic Coordinnate system. If it is great for dataset on a global scale, for more local ones, it might be interesting to use projected coordinate system. Arabesque provides a series of preset projection but you can also provide an EPSG code and the application will look for its definition on the website epsg.io. Projection toolbox Click on the Projection button to deploy the toolbox You can choose a projection from the list of provided ones Or you can enter an EPSG code to get the definition from the web. 2.2.1.1.1 Use a predefined projection Projection toolbox Click on the button to deploy the drop-down list Choose the projection you want Click on Change to change the map projection to the new one Projection change 2.2.2 Map panel The map panel cannot be hide, it is always visible. The map is automatically redraw when a side panel is opened/close. 1. Zoom in 2. Zoom out 3. Save project (archive the project settings in a zip file) 4. Export map as png file 5. Center map on current links 6. Export filtered data (csv in zip file) 7. Display fullscreen map 8. Hide/show layer management panel 9. Hide/show data handling panel 10. Legend 11. Scale 12. Base map attributions 2.2.3 Data handling panel The data handling provide several tools to handle nodes and links. From this panel, you can filter the data with Data handling panel organisation Add filter button Data summary Distance filter Count filter The procedure to add a filter is detailed below. The data summary provides some useful information about the filered information: Percentage of link represented on the map Percentage of volume represented Percentage of node represented All those values are from the kinks and nodes that were loaded. Please note that Arabesque automatically filter at first load. The distance and count filters are provided by default. 2.3 Manipulate filters The data is represented as an histogram. Here is the distribution of links size. Data histogram The min and max values are also displayed. You can filter the data with 2 ways: change min and max value resize and move the data window 2.3.1 Change min / max You can change the min and/or the max values in the fields below the histogram. For example, you want all data from a distance of 60 to 180. When you enter the new values, the grey window will change to fit the new values. This window represent the filtered data, the data that are displayed. This data window can be resized and displaced. Data filtering You can also verify that the data summary as changed 2.4 Resize and move the data window You can move the window by moving the cursor other it. When the cursor change to a cross, you can click on it and move it to the left or the right using your mouse. Move the window You can see that the values in the min and max fields and the data summary has change. You can also resize the window. Resize the data window When placing the cursor over the edge of the data window, the cursor will change to a left-right arrow. Click on the edge and move it to the right or the left to resize the window. Again, min or max values changes and the data summary too. 2.5 Add a new filter 2.6 Remove filter Remove filter To remove a filter, click on the bin icon on the right side of it. "],
